# Printer-Automation-Selection
This program allows a user to select which printer they would want to use as their default printer.
Its a simple terminal based application that quieries the computer for connected printers and then displays them to the user for easy choice of what they want to use.

This is very helpful for people who travel between buildings and need to always change their printer.
